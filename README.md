# Pets Home (Backend)
This is a backend application built with Spring Boot that serves as the backend for our web application. 
It provides RESTful API endpoints that our frontend can use to interact with our database.

## Database Configuration
This application uses a MySQL database to store user data. 
You can configure the database connection by modifying the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory. 

## How to run the application
* First clone the backend project using the command `git clone https://github.com/yasminemasmoudi/Backend-pets`
* Import the project using your preferred IDE (I recommend using Intellij Community version is fully sufficient)
* Update and build the project dependencies using the command mvn clean install -U
* Open the file PetsServiceApplication.java and run it using the green play button.
